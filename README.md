Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?
This is a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate program.

Background
Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company launched in 2016 that are offering their service across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Their has relied mainly on building up awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments, and the offer single ride passes and daily passes, as well as membership.

Cyclistic have noticed that customers with memberships are more profitable than other customers and see it as key for their growth to increase the number of members going forward. They now want to create a marketing campaign that targets casual users already aware of Cyclistic that could potentially be converted to members.

Now Cyclistic wants to know more about how casual users and members use their bike-sharing service and what the differences are between these two user groups. That will also be the focus of this project.

Ask
First I will consider the key stakeholders and identify the business task.

The Key Stakeholders As for the stakeholders, the main one would be the marketing director of Cyclistic. Also the marketing manager, including the team members involved in the project. C-level executives would also have an interest in this project and how it progresses.

The Business Task The task at hand is to compare casual users to members, in order to find insights that can be used to guide the marketing campaign that Cyclistic is planning. The project needs to clearly identify specific behavior that would indicate that certain causal users could be interested in a Cyclistic membership.

Prepare
The Data
For this project I will us one year's worth of data running from Aug, 2020 to Jul, 2021. It can be found here: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

Depending on when the data was collected it compiled by year, by quarter or by month, most likely due to the volume increasing over the years. Upon inspection of the data, it is clear that some changes have been made over the years when it comes to the format of the report.

The data is collected first-hand by Cyclistic and would be considered credible since I am getting it directly from the source. It has data about all unique rides during the set period, and includes information about bike type, user type, trip start and end times, trip start and end station etc.

As for the data collected during the period I am looking closer at it looks like columns have been consolidated, but there are some mixed data types, inconsitent value and extreme values that will need to be addressed during cleaning.

Due to privacy restrictions there is no information about the number of unique users or any information about who the users are. Therefore it is not possible to determine the actual number of users or find any patterns based on user backgrounds.
